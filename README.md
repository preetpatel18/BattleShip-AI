# BattleShip-AI
Battleship is a highly popular 1v1 game that requires a strategic mindset as well as a bit of luck. In this game, players have to place their ships into a 10x10 grid without overlapping, and they can only place them either vertically or horizontally. The same rules apply to the computer as well. Since you don't know where the computer has placed its ships, attacking their grid becomes a strategic method that largely depends on the probability of having a ship. My AI-powered assistant is capable of doing just that and can attack specific places rather than randomly choosing a spot. I created this project as a final assignment for my APCSA class in 10th grade, and it became one of the highest scorers in the entire section. Throughout this project, I learned a lot of new things about Java, especially in project and class management, as it involves multiple classes and connections that need to be changed simultaneously. This project was my first after learning the basics of Java, and I achieved a lot of new things while working on it.
